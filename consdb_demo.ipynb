    "# ConsDb Example\n",
    "\n",
    "*By Lynne Jones, on 9-20-2024*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration of the information available in the ConsDB. The ConsDB brings together information from the headers of images, information about observing conditions from the EFD, and per-visit information from analysis_tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ConsDB is still growing and a work in progress -- not all metadata that will be added is currently present. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ConsDb schema is a useful resource - the ConsDb schema for Auxtel (the `latiss` instrument) is available at https://sdm-schemas.lsst.io/cdb_latiss.html\n",
    "In the future, there are likely to be views of these schema (joins across various tables) available which will looks closer to current opsim outputs. \n",
    " \n",
    "Please note that the ConsDb is currently only available at the summit and USDF. It is not YET a community-available tool. By the time this is available to the community, I would expect that its interfaces would be considerably smoother and more filled out. "

Because these were simulated visits, and it was an operations *rehearsal* some of the metadata is not available -- we see that this metadata is appearing as expected in the latiss data above however."
